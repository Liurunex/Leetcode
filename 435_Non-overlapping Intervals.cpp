/* the idea: greedy + sort, much simialr to meeting roow II and burst baloons: just
 * sort the intervals based its start position (if tie we consider end position order),
 * inital the previous end record as first interval's end, then we do our GREEDY iteration:
 * for interval i, two cases: if it started after the previous end, we are fine and no need
 * to delete any interval, but just update the previous end record to current intervals; in
 * other case: the current interval overlap with the previous one, we have delete one of them:
 * and this is where GREEDY taking place -> we keep the one with less range, and delete the one
 * with higer end boundary, why this? simple reason: we want to keep the confliction made by
 * current two intervals affecting less intervals in future, namely, lower end boundary decrese
 * the chances of conflictions of future intervals
